# NATURAL-GAS-SPOT-PRICE-PREDICTION
NATURAL GAS SPOT PRICE PREDICTION USING THE HYBRID RANDOM FOREST-SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION-GENETIC ALGORITHM (RF-SVR-GA) MODEL
# Abstract
In the era of global energy transition, as natural gas has gained significant attention as a clean and efficient fossil fuel to reduce energy and environmental issues. Predicting natural gas prices serves as a crucial tool for reducing market energy price uncertainty, playing a vital role in commodity trading and regulatory decision making. This study aims to develop a model for predicting Henry Hub natural gas spot prices using a hybrid approach that combines Random Forest (RF) for feature selection, Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for prediction, and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for hyperparameter optimization. The results indicate that:(1) Feature selection with Random Forest reduces the time required and improves model accuracy. (2) The best accuracy results, considering evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), are shown by the hybrid RF-SVR-GA model compared to based SVR and RF-SVR models.
